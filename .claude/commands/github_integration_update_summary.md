# GitHub Issue Integration Update Summary

## Overview
All remaining agent prompts have been successfully updated to integrate GitHub issue tracking workflows. The agents now use GitHub issues as their primary state management and coordination mechanism.

## Updated Agents

### 1. Task Breakdown Agent (`task_breakdown_agent.md`)
- **Purpose**: Converts architectural designs into implementable tasks
- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Reads task breakdown requests from GitHub issues
  - Reads linked architecture design issues
  - Creates individual task issues for each major component
  - Updates issues with complete task breakdown
  - Creates planning coordination issue for next phase

### 2. Detailed Planning Agent (`detailed_planning_agent.md`)
- **Purpose**: Converts coarse tasks into step-by-step implementation plans
- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Queries for tasks labeled `agent:detailed-planning`
  - Reads task issues to understand requirements
  - Updates each task with detailed implementation plans
  - Changes labels to route tasks to implementation agent
  - Creates implementation coordination issue when all planning is complete

### 3. Implementation Agent (`implementation_agent.md`)
- **Purpose**: Executes implementation plans to build proof of concept software
- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Queries for tasks labeled `agent:implementation` and `status:planned`
  - Claims tasks by updating status to in-progress
  - Updates issues with progress during implementation
  - Creates bug issues for blockers
  - Closes issues when implementation is complete
  - Updates main project issue when all tasks are done

### 4. Programming Lead Agent (`programming_lead_agent.md`)
- **Purpose**: Research coordination and delegation
- **GitHub Integration** (adapted for research workflow):
  - Reads research requests from GitHub issues
  - Documents research plans in issue comments
  - Updates progress during research phases
  - Delivers final research reports via issues
  - Creates follow-up research issues if needed

## Key Integration Patterns

### Common Elements Added to All Agents:
1. **GitHub Issue Integration** section at the beginning
2. **github_workflow** section explaining the issue-based workflow
3. **github_issue_completion** section at the end with specific commands

### Label Management:
- Agents use labels to coordinate handoffs
- Status labels track progress (planned → in-progress → completed/blocked)
- Agent labels route work to appropriate agents
- Phase labels indicate workflow stage

### Issue Linking:
- All issues reference parent issues for traceability
- Agents create follow-up issues for the next phase
- Comments link related issues together

## Benefits of Integration

1. **Persistent State**: All work is tracked in GitHub issues
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Labels indicate which agent should work on what
3. **Progress Visibility**: Status labels and comments show current state
4. **Work History**: Complete audit trail of all decisions and progress
5. **Resumability**: Agents can pick up work by reading issue history
6. **Parallel Work**: Multiple agents can work on different issues simultaneously

## Next Steps

The agent workflow is now fully integrated with GitHub issues. To use the system:

1. Create an initial project issue with requirements
2. Label it for the appropriate starting agent (usually `agent:software-architect` or `agent:problem-analysis`)
3. Agents will create and update issues as they progress through the workflow
4. Monitor progress by viewing issues with different status labels
5. Use GitHub's issue search and filtering to track work across the project
